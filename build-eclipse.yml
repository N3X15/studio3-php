# BUILD CONFIGURATION FILE.
#
# The purpose of this is to organize the build properties into a nice,
#  clean, and VERSIONED setup, while still permitting secret stuff (like passwords).
#
# Each of the files referenced in ant.properties.files will get merged into the outfile 
#  and then fed directly to ant via -propertiesfile in Jenkins. (The buildscript can run
#  ant, as well, but it tends to mess up Jenkins' error scanner.)
# 
# Refer to /properties for more information.
